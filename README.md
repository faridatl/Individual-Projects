Welcome to the Stroke Prediction Project repository! This project focuses on utilizing machine learning algorithms to predict and analyze the likelihood of stroke occurrence, contributing to proactive healthcare strategies.

üîç Key Features:

Rigorous data preprocessing, handling missing values and outliers, accurately categorizing attributes as either categorical or numerical and ensuring proper assignment. 
Implementation of diverse supervised learning models, including Naive Bayes, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Decision Trees.
Comprehensive evaluation metrics, including accuracy, precision, and recall, to assess and fine-tune predictive models.
Interactive data exploration through visualizations like correlation matrices, pie charts, histograms, and plots.

üí° Objective:

Our primary objective is to build accurate and reliable models that aid in early stroke detection. This repository serves as a valuable resource for understanding the application of machine learning in healthcare, promoting proactive health management.

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used:

Python: Leveraging the power of Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-Learn.
Jupyter Notebooks: Transparent and interactive documentation of the entire workflow.


üìà Results:

The findings reveal that the Multinomial Naive Bayes model achieved an overall accuracy of 84%, with a precision rate of 86% for correctly predicting stroke cases. Notably, the classifier demonstrated a high recall of 97%, indicating its effectiveness in correctly identifying the majority of stroke patients when they are present.

## Stroke Prediction

  ### Objective: Implemented supervised learning models to predict whether a patient is likely to have a stroke or not based on collected features. Model performance is taken into account by comparing overall model accuracy, precision, and recall scores.
  
  Skills Demonstrated: 
     #### Data Cleaning/Preprocessing: 
      #### EDA: Exploring patient behavior and identifying key features through correlation maps, histograms, and plots.
      #### Machine learning: Implementing supervised learning models such as Naive Bayes, KNN, Random Forest, and Decision Tree to carry out predictions and calculate appropriate model metrics.
