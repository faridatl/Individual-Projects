# Individual-Projects

### Project 1: Stroke Prediction

  Objective: Implemented supervised learning models to predict whether a patient is likely to have a stroke or not based on collected features. Model performance is taken into account by comparing overall model accuracy, precision, and recall scores.
  
  Skills Demonstrated: 
     /n Data Cleaning/Preprocessing: Handling missing values and outliers, accurately categorizing attributes as either categorical or numerical and ensuring proper assignment.
      EDA: Exploring patient behavior and identifying key features through correlation maps, histograms, and plots.
      Machine learning: Implementing supervised learning models such as Naive Bayes, KNN, Random Forest, and Decision Tree to carry out predictions and calculate appropriate model metrics.

### Project 2: Credit Card Churn Prediction

  Objective: To employ supervised learning models in Python to assess and predict the likelihood of a credit card customer either staying or churning while also comparing these models to determine the best performance based in metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.
  
  Skills Demonstrated: 
      Data Cleaning/Preprocessing: Checks for missing and duplicate values, removal of irrelevant columns/rowa, label encoding of binary categorical features, and the creation of dummy variables for non-binary categorical features to ensure optimal quality for predictive modeling.     
    ## EDA: ## Generating correlation graphs/maps, pie charts, histograms, and plots to explore and visualize the relationships between the features in the dataset.
      Machine learning: Implemented Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, SVM, and KNN algorithms to carry out predictions. Overall model accurscy, precison, and recall metrics were calculated to evaluate the effectiveness of each algorithm in prredicting whether a credit card customer would churn.
      Data Visualization: Utilized a confusion matrix for all algorithms used in order to provide a detailed breakdown of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives. These offered valuable insight into each model's performsnce and aided in the assessment of predictive accuracy.

### Project 3: Recommendation System Implementation:

  Objective: To utilize the collected data to generate insightful recommendations based on a user's viewing history (my own) from Netflix, and determine whether similar genres would be recommended based on that user's profile.
  
  Skills Demonstrated: 
      Data Cleaning/Preprocessing: Initial dataset included the viewing history of 4 profiles (people). Due to time constraint only 1 profile was used in order to truly focus on the "Similar genre" reccomendation aspect of the recommendation system.
      Machine learning: Employs cosine similarity, a robust machine learning metric, to measure the similarity between user preferences and content genres, facillitating the generation of accurate and personalized recommendations.
      

### Project 4: Netflix Data Analysis
  
  Objective: To explore my Netflix viewing history with the use of bar graphs, etc,
  
  Skills Demonstrated: 
      Data Cleaning/Preprocessing: 
      EDA:
      Data Visualization: Bar graphs were deployed to depict the Top 10 Shows and Top 10 Genres from data collected and exhibit how the two differed and where they shared similarities.
