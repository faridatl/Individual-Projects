# Individual-Projects
Welcome to my GitHub repository where I showcase my individual projects 
that demonstrate my skills in data science, including machine learning, 
data cleaning, data visualization, and exploratory data analysis (EDA). 
This portfolio is a testament to my commitment to leveraging data to gain 
valuable insights and make informed decisions.
