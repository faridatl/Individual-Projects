## Stroke Prediction

  ### Objective: Implemented supervised learning models to predict whether a patient is likely to have a stroke or not based on collected features. Model performance is taken into account by comparing overall model accuracy, precision, and recall scores.
  
  Skills Demonstrated: 
     #### Data Cleaning/Preprocessing: Handling missing values and outliers, accurately categorizing attributes as either categorical or numerical and ensuring proper assignment.
      #### EDA: Exploring patient behavior and identifying key features through correlation maps, histograms, and plots.
      #### Machine learning: Implementing supervised learning models such as Naive Bayes, KNN, Random Forest, and Decision Tree to carry out predictions and calculate appropriate model metrics.
